Summary
-------

My name is Evert, and I've been a Web Developer for almost 15 years. I've been
doing consulting for a wide range of companies, from small businesses to
telcos, financial services and national broadcasters.

I'm especially interested in API design, implementing better engineering
practices, scalability problems and application architecture. In the past I've
had a strong focus on PHP, but I'm very open to other technology stacks as
well. I also have decent soft skills and served as CTO and technical leadership
in most of the companies I've worked at.

I'm currently looking for my next big thing! I would love to start a new venture
or join a young, promising business. How can I help?

Experience
----------

### Software Engineer at Yelp, Toronto, San Francisco - 2017-today

Turnstyle got acquired by Yelp. At Yelp my title changed to Software Engineer,
but I'm pretty much doing the same thing as I did as Turnstyle, that is:

I helped design a REST API and manage the team that's building it.


### API Architect at Turnstyle, Toronto, Canada - 2016-2017

In October 2016, I joined Turnstyle, a company in Toronto that does location-
based marketing analytics.

My role here is to help drive the design and architecture of a REST API. We've
used HAL, OAuth2, json-schema to drive the hypermedia API using NodeJS, ES6,
ES7. On a docker-container infrastructure running on Amazon Web Services.


### Co-Founder/CTO fruux, Germany + UK — 2011 - 2015

In December 2011 I went full-time with fruux, which was a bit of a
side-project at the time. We got a seed investment round, and opened the
door to our office. As the technical lead I’ve been responsible for the
technical and product direction, as well as leading the team from a
technical perspective. Aside from that I’ve also got my hands dirty in some
marketing and sales, and basically just stepped in where needed.

### Consulting, worldwide — 2003-today

I've been a consultant / freelancer pretty much at any point in my career where
there's gaps between jobs.

I’ve had the opportunity to work in
telecommunication, social media, group ware, advertising, broadcasting,
financial service companies in Australia, Portugal, Canada and The
Netherlands, and remotely worked for various other companies from North
America, Europe and Asia.

Used many different technologies such PHP / Lamp stack, NodeJS, Lots of
Javascript, AWS, Backbone, Golang, Sass/Less, or basically whatever tech the
job called for.

### Software engineer, Ibuildings, Utrecht, Netherlands — 2010-2011

In 2010 I started working for Ibuildings in the Netherlands as a senior
software engineer. Ibuildings is a software development company based in
The Netherlands and London, UK specializing in PHP and other web-related
technologies.
My role was primarily in leading development teams, training and development.
I’ve worked here on scalability issues for nu.nl (the number one Dutch news
site), designed Javascript/YUI3 based ‘fat’ javascript clients, (RESTful)
Web-service development and in-house training around subjects such as
web-services design, and a full-day javascript workshop.

### Lead architect/owner, Filemobile, Toronto, Canada — 2006-2014

After working with Filemobile as a contractor, I took on the job as lead
architect. Being the first person on the payroll, I was given the task of
making both the application and business scalable by hiring and managing new
engineers and putting development processes in place. For Filemobile, I
developed a scalable social network and user-generated content whitelabel
engine, working with Canada’s leading media brands such as CBC, CTV, Fox, TSN,
CP24.

In this job I worked with PHP, complicated multi-master, MySQL setups (with
geographic redundancy), Memcached, Amazon S3 and EC2 and I was responsible
for developing a multi-core, multi-machine transcoding engine as well as
leading the development team.
Starting August 2009 I resigned as lead architect to continue my work as
independent consultant, after that I was still involved as in an advisory role
and owner.

In late 2015 the company was sold to NewZulu, an Australian-based media
company.

### Senior Web developer/partner, Collab, Utrecht, the Netherlands — 2004-2006

Together with Collab I’ve got a taste of many experimental innovative software,
such as real-time, multi-user rich internet applications including web video
chat and media conversion. Using technologies such as Flash Communication
Server (now Flash Media Server) and FFMpeg. In these 3 years I’ve worked with
Dutch media and internet companies, such as NOS, BNN, Telegraaf/Speurders.nl,
EasyConcepts, Netmasters and UDC/Dancevalley.

### Application developer/Sys admin, V/d Veer, Surhuisterveen, The Netherlands — 2003

Developed and implemented a car inventory and lease database. The Database was
based on Interbase, the front-end was built using Borland Delphi. I got this
job as an intern, and I was forced to jump in and learn many technologies that
were new for me at the time, such as SQL.

### Junior sys admin/Tech support, Microdesk, Rijswijk, The Netherlands — 2001

This job involved many system administrator tasks, such as working with
hardware, installing and preparing massive amounts of desktop machines and
occasionally getting coffee for the more senior people in the company.

### Blogging

I've been blogging on and off since 2006. Here's some of my favourites:

<ul>
{% for post in site.tags.featured %}
  <li>
     <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
     <span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span>
