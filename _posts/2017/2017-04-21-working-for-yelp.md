In a twisted turn of events, I suddenly find myself to be working for [Yelp][1]!
It sounds a bit like it was a surprise, and it kind of was. Only 6 months after
I started my job at [Turnstyle][3], it [got acquired by Yelp][2].

I would joke "I must have done something right", but the truth is that I work
with some extremely smart and genuine people, who totally earned this.

Working for a much larger company like Yelp will be a huge adventure, and a
massive experience to learn from, so I feel really lucky to have jumped on this
chance at just the right moment. I can't wait to build great things with an army
of smart people.

And who knows, maybe I'll get to see a bit more of San Francisco in the future!
