Mark Nottingham is working on a great [guide][1] titled "Building Protocols
with HTTP".

Regardless of if you are doing pure REST or some variant, this guide has an
absolute wealth of information that everyone should read at least once before
building something on HTTP.

It's matter-of-fact, concise and unopinionated.
