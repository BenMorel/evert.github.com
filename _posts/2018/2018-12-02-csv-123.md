My current job involves a lot of spreadsheets and financial data. Like my last
few jobs, I'm still mainly building REST API's, but some of them now use
`text/csv` and [`Link:`][1] headers instead of HAL!

Anyway, I had trouble finding a simple CLI-based tool to browser .csv files,
and was reminded of an MS-DOS application that my dad used to use on his 386
IBM PS/2: [Lotus 1-2-3][2].

Specifically I remember being around 8 years old and just staring over his
shoulders when doing spreadsheets. I was just obsessed with anything computer
related, or at least that's what I'm told.

In my memory I could specifically remember a cyan CGA-like interface, like
you can see in screenshots from this [Obituary for Lotus 1-2-3 from The Register][3].

Anyway, I had a day off and decided to make a CLI-based viewer of .csv files
in Golang. It's read-only, and not a 100% faithful replication of Lotus 1-2-3,
but it's homage/nod to both the application and my dad!
