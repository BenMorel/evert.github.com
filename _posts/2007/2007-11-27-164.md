If you're a PHP developer, you'll likely often need to open up php.net to find
out the [the order of ;)] arguments for a function.

Generally i just type, php.net/functionname, but if you want to save 4 more
keystrokes you can easily add a quick search. Just open up your bookmarks (or
places if you're on FF3). And add a new bookmark to the Quick Searches folder.

<img src="/resources/images/posts/phpquicksearch.png" alt="PHP quicksearch" />

Use 'php' in the keyword field, and for the url, use:

    http://www.php.net/search.php?show=quickref&pattern=%s

Now, you can simply type _php in_array_ in your address bar, and you can find
out if the needle or the haystack comes first.

_p.s.: similarly, the 'slang' quicksearch has helped me adjust to north america a lot ;)_

_p.p.s.: lovin' the firefox 3 experience on beta, can't wait for all the extensions to work.._
