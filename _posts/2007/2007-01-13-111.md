Edwin Koster found a pretty big bug in AMF3 deserializing, which was actually
also identified by [Patrick Mineault][1] right before my vacation.. Thanks for
those bug reports!

That one's fixed now.. It was related to AMF3 object deserialization. For the
people using SabreAMF for their flex projects: Upgrading is highly recommended!

IExternalized and ArrayCollection
---------------------------------

Additionally, I added `IExternalized`-object support. What most likely the
biggest change is for people, is that the `ArrayCollection` object now arrives
differently. Before it would have been an anonymous object with the `source`
property containing the data, now there's an actualy php equivalent for the
`ArrayCollection` object, namely `SabreAMF_ArrayCollection`.

If you want to see how it works, I'd recommend simply checking out
[the source][2].

For people who don't know PHP5's SPL objects too well, the `ArrayCollection`
implements `IteratorAggregate`, `Countable` and `ArrayAccess`.. in practice
this means you can do most general Array operations on this object..

```php
<?php

$data = array();
$data[] = array('property1'=>'yo','property2'=>'test2');
$data[] = array('property1'=>'foo','property2'=>'bar');

$arrayCollection = new SabreAMF_ArrayCollection($data);

foreach($arrayCollection as $row) {

   // So yea, you can just loop through it like a normal array (done through IteratorAggregate)

}

// Or get values straight from a certain row (done through ArrayAccess)
echo($arrayCollection[0]['property1']);

// Or get the total number of rows (done through countable)

echo(count($arrayCollection));

// In the case you need a normal array, based on the ArrayAccess class

$normalArray = iterator_to_array($arrayCollection);

?>
```

If you want to check out how to create your own externalized objects..
(remember this always has to go paired; create one in flex, and create one in
php), base your class on the [SabreAMF_Externalized interface][3].

Also, be sure to let me know if there are any other well known flex classes
that could really use SabreAMF equivalents..

The only other change is, that if exceptions don't provide a value for the
'code' property, the classname is passed by default.

Upgrade/Download
----------------

As usual you can upgrade using:

```
pear upgrade http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/SabreAMF/downloads/SabreAMF-latest.tgz
```

Or do a fresh install with:

```
pear install http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/SabreAMF/downloads/SabreAMF-latest.tgz
```

Mailing list
------------

I'd also like to point out that there's a mailing list do drop your
questions.. The response might be quicker than the comment box..
