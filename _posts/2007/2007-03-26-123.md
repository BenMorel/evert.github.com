This is for the googlers who might run into the same problem as me..

If you try to use ExternalInterface, your flash object should not be a in a
html `<form>` tag.. If that is the case, ExternalInterface will not work at all!

I had a hard time figuring this out, until I stumbled upon a comment in the
[LiveDocs][1].
