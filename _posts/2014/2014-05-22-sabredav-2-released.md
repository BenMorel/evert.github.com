It's been 18 months since 1.8, and almost 5 years since the 1.0 release.

But we've finally managed to wrap up the 2.0 release for sabre/dav. PHP 5.3
support is now dropped, and it spawned two new php packages: [sabre/event][1]
and [sabre/http][2].

We've made lots of performance jumps, did a ton of refactoring and added a
bunch of new features.

Thanks everyone for hanging in there, and I hope everybody likes what we've
done so far ;).

The [full announcement][3] can be found on the [website][3].
