<p>I'm in the process of writing an API that relies on (file-)streams to be passed around.</p>

<p>There are situations where a string instead needs to be used, and for these purposes the <a href="http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php">data: stream wrapper</a> is used. Initially I thought it was only possible to encode the actual string in base64, which I didn't like because of the added footprint.</p>

```php
<?php

$string = "I should have really done some laundry tonight.";

$stream = fopen('data://text/plain;base64,' . base64_encode($string),'r');

echo stream_get_contents($stream);

?>
```

<p>Quickly checking out the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2397">rfc</a>, it turns out that ';base64' can be omitted to just pass along the raw data, which makes a lot more sense in the context of PHP.</p>

<p>Thankfully, PHP gladly supports it:</p>

```php
<?php

$string = "I tried, honestly!";

$stream = fopen('data://text/plain,' . $string,'r');

echo stream_get_contents($stream);

?>
```
