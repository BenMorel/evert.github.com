<p>After lots of testing, coding and integrating SabreDAV in a few systems, SabreDAV has reached 1.0.</p>

<h3>What's that?</h3>

<p>For those of you randomly stumbling on this blog, SabreDAV is a tool I've been working on to allow easy integration of PHP and WebDAV. While looking at WebDAV implementions out there for PHP, there weren't really any standards-compliant and flexible solutions out there, so I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>Since then it has gained some popularity, and the beta version has been tested and implemented in a number of places. It's open source (under the BSD license), so anybody can grab it and use it.</p>

<p>If you don't really know what WebDAV is, it is basically a filesystem protocol that works on top of HTTP. By implementing WebDAV (or SabreDAV specifically) you are able to expose your web application as if it was a filesystem to the users. WebDAV is supported by any major operating system.</p>

<p>If you're interested in SabreDAV, check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/source/browse/trunk/examples/fileserver.php">example</a>, or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/GettingStarted">tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>The last round of changes since 0.12.1 are mostly cleanups, but the most important are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/SimpleDirectory">SimpleDirectory class</a></li>
  <li>Authentication plugin is no longer included. The plugin was not yet production ready, and in order to allow myself to make API changes, I needed to remove it for 1.0. This <strong>does not</strong> mean you can no longer use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/Authentication">recommended way</a> to implement authentication.</li>
  <li>The unknownProperties event was removed, replaced by the afterGetPropertiesEvent (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/WritingPlugins">docs</a>).</li>
  <li>Addition of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/WritingPlugins">more events</a> for plugin writers.</li>
  <li>Lots of cleaning up, unittests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future plans</h3>

<p>Although the 1.0 version should be a bit of a milestone, the release had actually been sitting ready for a while. So while 1.0 is cool and all, I've already spent a great deal of time implementing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3744.txt">RFC 3744 a.k.a. ACL extensions for WebDAV</a>. Support for ACL will be added as a separate module in the future.</p>

<p>While these changes are going on, no backwards compatibility breaking changes should be made to the API's. For more details on the BC and versioning policy, check <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/VersionPolicy">here</a>.

<h3>Thanks!</h3>

<p>It's been a lot of hard work to get here, but seeing some uptake is very rewarding. I would probably have given up on this if it weren't for the people asking questions, making suggestions and filing reports. Thanks for that, it makes it worth it!</p>
