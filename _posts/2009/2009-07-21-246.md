<p>Just released the 0.9 version of SabreDAV.</p>

<p>This release mainly contains bugfixes and some API changes that will facilitate future extensions, such as ACL and CalDAV.</p>

  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/Migrating0_8to0_9">Migrating from 0.8 to 0.9</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/source/browse/trunk/ChangeLog">Full Changelog</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although these changes might not be relevant to most people, upgrading is recommended in order to keep a solid upgrade path. Fortunately for most people the API breaks are minimal.</p>
