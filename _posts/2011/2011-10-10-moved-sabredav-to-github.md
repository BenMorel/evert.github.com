<p>I've finally taken the plunge and moved the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/">SabreDAV</a> source from Google code to <a href="https://github.com/evert/SabreDAV">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The main reason is that I'm hoping that people are more likely to fork and contribute. This was possible as well on googlecode, but I think people had a bit more trouble getting used to the feature.</p>

<p><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> is still the best source control system, but I feel switching to Git was worth it, solely for GitHub.</p>

<p>You can find the source at <a href="https://github.com/evert/SabreDAV">https://github.com/evert/SabreDAV</a>.</p>
