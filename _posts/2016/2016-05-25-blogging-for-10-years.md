10 years ago today I first started this blog. I guess at this point it might
be the longest running 'thing' I've ever done. Back then I had never been on
an airplane, but since then  I've blogged from every continent except
Antartica.

Although blogging isn't nearly as cool as it used to be, and twitter has
largely replaced RSS, I'm happy to say it's still going strong and it's still
fun!

I had some of my most read posts this year, but sadly I noticed that there's
a very obvious correlation between popularity and writing somewhat low-effort
opinion pieces. My most popular post was pretty much about how
[I hate LinkedIn][1], which got around 23000 page views. Articles like that
completely drown out the ones I actually care about, but on the upside, that
particular post actually got me 4 new customers for my freelance work.

Technology wise I've gone from a custom solution, to [Habari][2], eventually
landing on [Github Pages][3] + [Disqus][4]. Disqus has become more and more
social media and less 'comment box' and they added some dark patterns,
 so if you have a different recommendation I'd love to hear it! Especially if
I can import from Disqus. 

Since this year this blog is also running on HTTPS via the HTTPi/2 protocol.
You gotta practise what you preach after all! This is provided via
[Cloudflare][5], which is a nice service and free if your needs are simple.

Anyway, one thing I have to say is... I'm extremely happy that I've started
this all this time ago. Twitter is nice, but my blog archive gives me an
awesome archive on what things interested me over the years. The blog has
opened many doors, including jobs and gigs and sometimes just getting the
benefit of the doubt.

It's by far been my most useful career development tool.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
