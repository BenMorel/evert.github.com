Yesterday I did a talk titled "Go for PHP programmers" at the Toronto PHP
meetup. The slides don't properly represent what I talked about there,
as I chatted a lot more about PHP, while showing Go examples, but if
you're interested, the [slides are here][1].

For the slides I decided to use [cleaver][2] this time, which is a simple
presentation tool that turns markup into a HTML slideshow. I'd definitely
recommend it if you want a slideshow in 30 seconds, but it's a bit lacking
if you're looking for anything beyond the most basic features.
