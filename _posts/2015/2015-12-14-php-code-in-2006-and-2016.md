I've been writing PHP code for almost 15 years, and next year will be the 10 year
anniversary of this blog.

Back when I started the blog, PHP 5 had just come out. It occurred to me that it
might be interesting to take a quick look how my PHP code has changed in this
timespan. It might also not be interesting, in which case: leave now!

So I dug up some old code and created two fictional code samples, representing
a class I might have written in 2006 and 2016.

2006
----

This first example is based off an old open source project that originally
had PHP 5.0.4 as the minimum version requirement.

Back then my toolkit contained:

* Vim.
* Firefox 1 (and installing it on anyone's computer, whenever they weren't
  looking).
* A borrowed Powerbook G4 running OS X Tiger, or maybe a custom built PC running
  XP and two yellowed 15" CRT monitors.
* Basically all development in a SSH session on a Slackware Linux box. Or
  maybe Debian.
* PEAR.
* Subversion.
* A worn down `F5` button on my keyboard for debugging.

```php
<?php

    /**
     * A music player!
     *
     * @package Sabre_MusicPlayer
     * @version $Id$

     * @example ../examples/player.php
     */
    class Sabre_MusicPlayer_Player {

        /**
         * Some id
         *
         * @var int
         */
        public $id;

        /**
         * Secret key
         *
         * @var string
         */
        private $key;

        /**
         * Repeat the song x times
         *
         * @param int $times
         * @return bool
         */
        public function repeat($times) {
        }

        /**
         * Adds a new song to the playlist
         *
         * @param Sabre_MusicPlayer_Song $song
         * @throws Sabre_MusicPlayer_DrmException
         * @return void
         */
        public function addSong(Sabre_MusicPlayer_Song $song) {
        }

        /**
         * Returns all songs
         *
         * @return array
         */
        public function getSongs() {

            return array();

        }

        /**
         * Returns a singleton instance
         *
         * @return Sabre_MusicPlayer_Player
         */
        public static function getInstance() {
        }

        /**
         * Secret stuff!
         */
        private secret() {
        }

    }

?>
```

* For some crazy reason all my sources were intended by 4 spaces! Everything!
* `@version $Id$` was a special tag that subversion could recognize and would
  automatically insert version information in every file.
* `@licence` was misspelled, and it would take me several years to find the
  mistake in hundreds of files.


2016
----

It's almost 2016 now and PHP 7 is out. This is the style I'll use for new projects:

```php
<?php

namespace Sabre\MusicPlayer;

/**
 * A music player!
 *
 * @copyright Copyright (C) fruux GmbH (https://fruux.com/).
 * @author Evert Pot (http://evertpot.com/)
 * @license http://sabre.io/license/ Modified BSD License
 */
class Player {

    /**
     * Some id
     *
     * @var int
     */
    public $id;

    /**
     * Secret key
     *
     * @var string
     */
    private $key;

    /**
     * Repeat the song x times
     */
    function repeat(int $times): bool {
    }

    /**
     * Adds a new song to the playlist
     *
     * @throws DrmException
     * @return void
     */
    function addSong(Song $song) {
    }

    /**
     * Returns all songs
     */
    function getSongs(): array {

        return [];

    }

    /**
     * Returns a singleton instance
     */
    static function getInstance(): self {
    }

    /**
     * Secret key
     *
     * @var string
     */
    private $key;

    /**
     * Secret stuff!
     */
    private secret() {
    }

}
```

* Starting next year, I'm dropping the copyright years from all source files.
  As far as I'm aware, there's no real legal reason to keep them, so it's
  vanity. It causes a massive 'Happy new year' commit every year in the Git
  repository though, so 2016 will be the last!
* Since PHP 5.3, we got [namespaces][1]! This has a pretty major impact on line
  lengths in lots of places. It also removed the `@package` declaration and in
  many cases `@use`.
* A somewhat recent change is that I removed all `public` function and
  property modifiers where possible. The `public` keyword literally does
  nothing, and I'm unconvinced that it actually helps people understand the
  source. In fact, I think the opposite. The `public` keyword pushes the
  functionname further to the right which means more scanning.
* I'm removing all `@param`, `@var` and `@return` tags where they can be
  inferred from the source. In the past I've always kept an entire block of
  `@param` tags for every argument. Now that most types can be typehinted (in
  PHP7) it's not really needed anymore.
* Before, I would list all properties in a class first, and functions second.
  Now I've started grouping them based on visibility. That means that the
  public properties come first, public functions next, protected properties,
  and so on. This makes a lot more sense for people reading the source, as
  someone who only interacts with the public API of a class, does not need to
  read about protected or private properties. It will move the things that
  are more likely to be relevant upward.
* PHP 5.4 array syntax. Even though this change was mostly cosmetic, it's
  the primary reason I dropped PHP 5.3 support when I reasonabily could.
* Since many years none of my sources have had a `?>`, which probably helped me
  avoid a bunch of bugs before I used [PHPUnit][7]/[PHP-CS-Fixer][13]
  consistently.

I still don't care about [PSR-2][10]. I helped split [PSR-1][9] and PSR-2
to ensure that people can follow the important stuff (PSR-1) while keeping
creative freedom with their sources (PSR-2). I'm not about to change that
in 2016.

Right now I'm considering two more controversial changes:

1. Reducing all indentation in classes by 1 more level. This will place every
   function right on the first column. There's no super strong argument
   against this, as you kind of know you're working inside a class.
2. Change my `public $foo` declarations back into `var $foo`, to really drive
   home the point that "we don't need `public`". I'm worried that that one
   doesn't really carry many benefits other than "nonconformance is fun".


### Other changes

* Moved from Google Code Hosting to Bitbucket (briefly) to Github.
* Moved from Subversion, to Mercurial to Git.
* Moved from PEAR packages on "Pearfarm" to [Pirum][3] hosted on free
  SourceForge hosting to [Composer][4] and [Packagist][5].
* Moved from [PSR-0][2] to [PSR-4][6].
* Really went all-in with [PHPUnit][7], running all my tests on [Travis CI][8].
* Went from being really excited about OS X, to [kind of hating it][12].


Last thoughts
-------------

Looking back that's a fair amount of changes. Some of them were painful,
either because it was a lot of work (moving to namespaces) or because it
meant it's hard to change habits (for example mercurial. Still sad about
that) or because I'm plain stubborn. Aside from that, most of these changes
were gradual, and it's kind of interesting to take a step back and look at them
all at once.

What's also interesting is how forward looking PHP Documentor has been. Many
things that were in PHP Docblocks are now core PHP language features, the
latest examples being scalar typehints and the [splat operator][11].

I wonder if that's one day true for the following expressions as well:

```php
/**
 * @param int|string
 * @param int[]
 * @throws Something
 * @property-read int $myProperty
 */
```

Aside from my sources, I also think that architecturally I've moved to a
more minimal 'get the job done' type of approach. In the early days of PHP 5
I think a lot of us copied a lot of things that were happening in the
Java-world, but the reality is that that's a widely inappropriate place to look
for architectural inspiration when you're developing PHP applications.

The reality of PHP is that your entire program will need to initialize,
handle the request, serve the response and die again in milliseconds. A Java
developer only has to optimize the middle part.

So over time I feel like my source has become more Javascript-like. Less
typing, less objects for every bit of data, less configuration and a lot more
more convention, assumption, functional and event-based. Whereas before I might
have started a new bit of functionality as an abstract class or interface, now
it's likely to be a function until the point where I know polymorphism will pay
off. I think many people have seen this and moved from heavy java-inspired
frameworks (such as ZF1, Doctrine) to lighter solutions (such as Silex and Slim
and using non-relational datastores or plain PDO).


Bonus 2004 version
------------------

I also dug up an even older project to look at my style then. My code back
then was pretty awful, and I didn't really bother with many things such as
escaping or PHPDoc. So instead, here's how it might have looked like if I
was developer in 2004 and knew what I was doing. I tried to largely follow
PEAR's coding standards from back then.

```php

 */
class Sabre_MusicPlayer_Player
{

    /**
     * Some id
     *
     * @var int
     * @access public
     */
    var $id;

    /**
     * Secret key
     *
     * @var string
     * @access private
     */
    var $_key;

    /**
     * Repeat the song x times
     *
     * @param int $times
     * @access public
     * @return bool
     */
    function repeat($times)
    {
    }

    /**
     * Adds a new song to the playlist
     *
     * @param Sabre_MusicPlayer_Song $song
     * @access public
     * @return true|PEAR_Error
     */
    function addSong(Sabre_MusicPlayer_Song $song)
    {
    }

    /**
     * Returns all songs
     *
     * @access public
     * @return array
     */
    function getSongs()
    {

        return array();

    }

    /**
     * Returns a singleton instance
     *
     * @access public
     * @static
     * @return Sabre_MusicPlayer_Player
     */
    function getInstance()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Secret stuff!
     *
     * @access private
     * @return void
     */
    private _secret()
    {
    }

}
?>
```

A few notables here:

* There was no `public`, `private` and `protected`. Everything was public and
  you'd use PHPDoc to inform the user of the visibility with `@access`.
  I'm fairly certain that people were so excited for PHP 5 visibility
  keywords, that that was also the prime reason people placed `public` in every
  method signature.
* There was also no `static` or `abstract`. Any method could be called
  statically.
* Private members were generally prefixed with an underscore. This habit stuck
  around in many projects for years in the PHP 5 days.
* CVS for the win!
