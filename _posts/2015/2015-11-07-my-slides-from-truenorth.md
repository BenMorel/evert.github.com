This weekend I went to the [True North PHP conference][1]. First PHP
conference I went to since quite a few years, and it was a really great time.

My talk was about Promises and Generators and how they can be used together
in the form of coroutines.

If you're interested, I put my slides up on [Github][2]. A lot of my slides
have notes, so I kept it in the LibreOffice format. In that repository you'll
also find a bunch of references I used for research for my talk.
