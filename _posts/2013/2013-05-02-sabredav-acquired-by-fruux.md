Last week myself we've have finished the talks to transfer ownership
of the [SabreDAV][1] project to [fruux][2].

It was the logical choice, and in spirit this was probably already the case for
some time. I've been a lead dev there, and SabreDAV is really at the heart of
what we do and we spend a great deal of time maintaining it, and providing
support.

To me this was a big deal regardless. SabreDAV has been one of the very little
things that have remained consistent in my life, and while it validates my
work in one way, in another way it still feels like I'm letting go something
that's very important and personal.

However, I'll still be running the project so in reality that doesn't change
:).

What does it mean for you?
--------------------------

The github urls have changed. The new project pages are:

* https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav
* https://github.com/fruux/sabre-vobject
* https://github.com/fruux/sabre-xml

It also means that for the users that need have a need for support and backing
from a commercial entity, we can now provide it.

It also means we can start working on a new project page, which is long
overdue :).

Does this mean SabreDAV will go closed-source?
----------------------------------------------

No, I would never let this happen. SabreDAV will remain as open source as it
has always been, and we also don't intend on making it crippleware.
