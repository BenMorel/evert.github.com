[`207 Multi-Status`][1] is used primarily by WebDAV servers. I don't think
it's used much use outside of WebDAV.

The [WebDAV specification][1] describes this statuscode as an indicator to
a client that multiple operations happened, and that the status for each
operation can  be found in the body of the response.

So unlike other `2xx` codes, getting a `207` doesn't necessarily mean the
operation succeeded. It just means that the client should inspect the body
to get the true information about the operation.

The most common WebDAV example is that it has a feature to get information
about multiple resources all at once via the `PROPFIND` HTTP method. The
server can then report information about each individual resource via this
code.
