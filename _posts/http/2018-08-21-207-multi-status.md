[`207 Multi-Status`][1] is used primarily by WebDAV servers. I don't think
it's used much outside of WebDAV, if at all.

The [WebDAV specification][2] describes this statuscode as an indicator to
a client that multiple operations happened, and that the status for each
operation can  be found in the body of the response.

So unlike other `2xx` codes, getting a `207` doesn't necessarily mean the
operation succeeded. It just means that the client should inspect the body
to get the true information about the operation.

The most common WebDAV example is that it has a feature to get information
about multiple resources all at once via the `PROPFIND` HTTP method. The
server can then report information about each individual resource via this
code.

Here's an example of a typical `207` response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
Content-Length: xxxx

<d:multistatus xmlns:d="DAV:">
    <d:response>
        <d:href>/calendars/johndoe/home/132456762153245.ics</d:href>
        <d:propstat>
            <d:prop>
                <d:getetag>"xxxx-xxx"</d:getetag>
            </d:prop>
            <d:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</d:status>
        </d:propstat>
    </d:response>
    <d:response>
        <d:href>/calendars/johndoe/home/fancy-caldav-client-1234253678.ics</d:href>
        <d:propstat>
            <d:prop>
                <d:getetag>"5-12"</d:getetag>
            </d:prop>
            <d:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</d:status>
        </d:propstat>
    </d:response>
</d:multistatus>
```

In the preceeding response, 2 resources are reported and for each a `getetag`
WebDAV property is reported. Fully explaining the WebDAV model is outside the
scope of this article.

You could imagine that `207` _might_ be repurposed by some JSON-based API. For
example, if a client made some kind of batch request, and a server wants to
report back on the success of each individual item.

Perhaps this response looks somewhat like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: xxxx

{
  "results": [
    {
      "href": "/batch/5/item/1",
      "status": 200
    },
    {
      "href": "/batch/5/item/2",
      "status": 200
    },
    {
      "href": "/batch/5/item/3",
      "status": 400
    },
    {
      "href": "/batch/5/item/4",
      "status": 403
    }
}
```

I have some doubts whether this is a good idea though. Some questions I would
want to ask are:

* HTTP prefers requests to either fully succeed or fully fail. Do we really
  need to report on individual items or can we do this atomically instead?
* If we do want to report on multiple items, why not make these multiple HTTP
  requests instead?

If doing multiple HTTP requests is too expensive, I think it's wise to first
see if there's possibilities to reduce the cost of multiple HTTP requests,
before breaking HTTP semantics. `HTTP/2` might help because it allows for
multiple requests to be pipelined, and it keeps a single connection open.
