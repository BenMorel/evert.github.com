The IETF has a tradition to publish one or more april-fools RFC documents
every year. Among the most famous are [IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service][avian],
and of course [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol][htcpcp], which
introduced the `418 I'm a teapot` HTTP status.

This status-code is of course not an official one. You won't find it in the
[IANA HTTP Status code registry][iana-status]. However, people have such a
liking to it that it's supported in many HTTP libraries.

About a year ago, the [HTTP working group][httpwg] tried to reach out to
various projects to try and remove their support for `418`, so the number
could be re-used for a new purpose, but this was met with a lot of resistance,
even spawning <https://save418.com>.

Several implementations of HTCPCP can be found, including:

* [htcpcp-delonghi](https://github.com/dkundel/htcpcp-delonghi).
* [hypertext-coffeepot](https://github.com/HyperTextCoffeePot/HyperTextCoffeePot).

The `418` code also appears as easter eggs in numerous systems.

[Wikipedia has a page on all the IETF april fools jokes][wpfools], which is
well worth a read. It also features the [HTCPCP-TEA][htcpcp-tea] extension!

All we need now is a WHATWG living standard that just solidifies everyone's
buggy implementations (looking at you [URL standard][whatwg-url]), and a W3C
committee that forks it once per year.
