[`305 Use Proxy`][1] is a deprecated status code. Using the status-code a
server could instruct a client that it should connect to a proxy, and repeat
that same request there.

`305 Use Proxy` is deprecated due to security concerns. It shouldn't be used.
The idea is interesting, but I have a hard time coming up with real use-cases
for this status.

Example
------

```http
HTTP/1.1 305 Use Proxy
Location: https://proxy.example.org:8080/
```
