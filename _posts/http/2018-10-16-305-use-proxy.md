[`305 Use Proxy`][1] is a deprecated status code. Using the status-code a
server could instruct a client that it should connect to a proxy, and repeat
that same request there.

`305` kind of works like a redirect. It really tells a client: this resource
can only be fetched if you used the right proxy. Presumably a client could
connect to this proxy and via the proxy try the exact same request again to
get the real response.

`305 Use Proxy` is deprecated due to security concerns. It shouldn't be used.
I'm not aware of any implementors, although they might be out there.

Example
------

The following response would tell a client that it should attempt the same
request again via a proxy on `proxy.example.org`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 305 Use Proxy
Location: https://proxy.example.org:8080/
```
