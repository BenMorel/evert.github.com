[`204 No Content`][1] should be returned by a server when a request was
successful, but there was no response body.

For most APIs, the following two responses are the same:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

The second format has a slight preference by most API designers. The reason
there is a separate status-code, is because the `204 No Content` response can
signal a hypermedia client to not change the document and just stay on the
current 'view'. For example, a client might 'save' a document temporarily and
not refresh to a new page.

Personally I have not really seen this behavior, but I can absolutely see this
as a real possibility for a true HATEOAS client.

However, most of the time, `204` is simply used as a stand-in for `200` without
a response body.

`204 No content` is sometimes misunderstood by implementors of HTTP APIs to
indicate that the target resource 'no longer has any contents' after a
`DELETE` request. However, other successful requests that don't have a
response body should also have the `204 No Content` status, including `PUT`
and `POST`.
