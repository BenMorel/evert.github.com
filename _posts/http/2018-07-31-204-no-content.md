[`204 No Content`][1] should be returned by a server when a request was
successful, but when there was no response body.

For most APIs, the following two responses are the same:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

However, only the second is correct. The reason this status-code exists as a
separate code, is because it might instruct a hypermedia client to not change
the document and just stay on the current 'view'. Personally I have not really
seen this behavior, but I imagine it might exist.

Most of the time, `204` is simply used as a stand-in for `200` except with no
response body.

`204 No content` is sometimes misunderstood by implementors of HTTP APIs to
indicate that the target resource 'no longer has any contents' after a
`DELETE` request.

However, other successful requests that don't have a response body should also
have the `204 No Content` status, including `PUT` and `POST`.

It's not clear from the specification if `204` just overrides the [`200 OK`][2]
response, or also other success codes like [`201 Created`][3] and
[`202 Accepted`][4]. I would not recommend doing this, and _only_ use `204` if
you would otherwise want to return `200`, because the information `201` or
`202` imply seems more important to me than `204`. The exception to this rule
might be if you are building a hypermedia client and want to rely on the
behavior that a client does not refresh the view when it received a `204`.
