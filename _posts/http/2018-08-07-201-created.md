[201 Created][1], just like [`200 OK`][2], means that the request was
successful, but it also resulted in a new resource being created.

In the case of a `PUT` request, generally it means that a new resource
was created on the actual url in the request.

```http
PUT /new-resource HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/html
Host: example.org

...
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: "foo-bar"
```

In the case of a `POST` request, it might mean that a new resource was created
at a different endpoint. For those cases, a `Location` header must be included
to indicate where the new resource lives.

In the following example, we're creating a new resource via `POST`, and the
server responds with the new location and the `ETag` of the new resource.

```http
POST /collection/add-member
Content-Type: application/json
Host: example.org

...
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: "gir-zim"
Location: /collection/546
```
