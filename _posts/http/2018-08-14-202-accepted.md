[202 Accepted][1], means that the server accepted the request, but it's not
sure yet if the request will be completed successfully.

The specification calls it 'intentionally non-committal'. You might see API's
using this response for for example asynchronous batch processing. HTTP
doesn't have a standard way to communicate after the fact if the request was
successful or not, so an API using this might use some other facility to
indicate if the operation was successful or not.

For example, it might send an email to a user telling them that the batch
process worked, or it might expose another endpoint in the API that can
indicate the current status of a process.

Example:

```http
POST /my-batch-process HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

...
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Link: </batch-status/5545> rel="http://example.org/batch-status"
Content-Length: 0
```
