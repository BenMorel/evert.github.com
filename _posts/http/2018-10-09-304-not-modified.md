[`304 Not Modified`][1] is used in response to a conditional `GET` or `HEAD`
request. A request can be made condtional with one of the following headers:

* `If-Match`
* `If-None-Match`
* `If-Modified-Since`
* `If-Unmodified-Since`
* `If-Range`

`If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` are used specifically to allow a
client to cache results and asks the server to only send a new representation
if it has changed.

`If-Modified-Since` does this based on a `Last-Modified` header, and
`If-None-Match` with an `ETag`.


Example
-------

A client does an initial request:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html
```

A server responds with an ETag:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: text/html
ETag: "some-string"
```

The next time a client makes a request, it can include the ETag:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html
If-None-Match: "some-string"
```

If the resource didn't change on the server, it can return a `304`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
ETag: "some-string"
```
