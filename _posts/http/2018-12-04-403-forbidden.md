[`403 Forbidden`][1] should be used when a client is trying to do a request
it's not allowed to do for a variety of reasons. Maybe the user doesn't have
the right permissions, or maybe it's logged in with the wrong credentials.

It's a good generic status code for anything that's "not allowed" for a
variety of reasons, and is extremely common.

Example
------

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 32

<h1>403: You can't do that!</h1>
```

However, there are a few HTTP status codes for more specific situations.

* Use [401 Unauthorized][2] if the user can't do an operations because they
  haven't logged in yet.
* Use [405 Method Not Allowed][3] if the user has access to the resource, but
  the specific operation they're trying to do is not allowed. For example,
  calling `PUT` on a read-only resource.

There are a few others, and they'll be covered on this blog in the future.
