The URI or path of a HTTP request doesn't have any hard limits in terms of how
long it's allowed to be.

There are various reasons to limit it. [Browsers have limits][2], and on the
server side it's a good idea to limit the length of the URI to combat certain
denial-of-service attacks or bugs.

Based on limits of browsers, it's a good idea to try and not exceed 2000 bytes
for the uri.

When a client does exceed it, the appropriate status code to return is
`414 URI Too Long`.

Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 414 URI Too Long
Content-Type: text/html

<p>Insufficient level of conciseness in request</p>
```
