[`200 OK`][1] is the most common HTTP status code. It generally means that the
HTTP request succeeded.

If the HTTP request was a `GET` request, the response should include the full
representation of the resource.

If the response has no body, then the [`204 No Content`][2] response body
should be used instead.

Example:

```http
GET /hello-world.txt HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/*
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/markdown
Content-Length: 778 

[200 OK][1] is the most common HTTP status code. It generally means that the
HTTP request succeeded.
