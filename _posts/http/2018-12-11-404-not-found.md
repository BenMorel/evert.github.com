[`404 Not Found`][1] hardly needs an introduction. It's by far the most seen
status by developers and non-developers alike. `404` is emitted when a
resource doesn't exist, never existed or if the server doesn't want a client
to know that a resource exist.

If the server knows the resource doesn't and will never exist again,
[`410 Gone`][2] might be more appropriate.

Sometimes the `404` response is incorrectly used as a successful response to
a `DELETE` request. The logic behind this is that the resource no longer
exists after deleting, so the server should report this state.

However, this is technically wrong. Any response in the 400-499 series always
means that there was a (client) error. Even successful `DELETE` requests should
get a [`200 Ok`][3] or [`204 No Content`][4] response.

Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html

<h1>404 Not found</h1>
```
