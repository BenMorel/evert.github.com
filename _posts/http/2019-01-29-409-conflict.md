[`409 Conflict`][1] is used in cases where the HTTP request was valid, but the
current state of the server prevents it from being executed.

This is usefor for API's. A few hypothetical examples:

1. A user wants to add a file to a folder, but the folder doesn't exist yet.
2. Amazon S3 uses it when you try to delete a bucket that's not empty.
3. You're creating a new blog post, but it refers to a category that was
   deleted.

The key here is that it might be possible to run the same request again after
this conflict is resolved, by for example:

1. Creating the folder you're trying to upload to.
2. Removing all items from the S3 bucket before removing it.
3. Re-creating or undeleting the category you're trying to assign to the blog
   post.

The HTTP specification recommends that the HTTP response body contains
information in the response body that the client or user can use to resolve
the conflict.

Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: text/plain

You tried to upload a file to a folder that doesn't exist. Create the folder
and try again!
```

Usage
-----

If you are building an API, it's a good idea to emit 409 conflict for these
situations. It can be seen as a more specific code than 400 and somtimes 409.

You might even be able to define a response body that a client can use to
automatically resolve the conflict, or at least inform the user in a standard
way what was wrong.
