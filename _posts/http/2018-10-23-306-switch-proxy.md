The HTTP specifications, starting from [RFC2616][1] have a [gap][2] between
the `305` and `307` status codes.

The specification states:

> The 306 status code was defined in a previous version of this
> specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved.

Naturally I was curious what it _used_ to be, so I went through all the drafts
of [RFC2616][1] and [RFC2068][3], but couldn't find a mention of it, except
that it was reserved.

After some googling and digging into [old mailing list archives][5], I found a
separate [draft][4] unrelated to the core specification. This document from
1996 wants to define `306` as `306 Switch Proxy`.

Part of why it was brought up as an idea was confusion around the meaning of
`305 Use Proxy`, which was meant to only be used for a single request. If a
client would encounter `306 Switch Proxy`, it meant that it should use the proxy
for every following request.

This was deemed as a security risk, and ultimately dropped from the
specifications. `306` should _not_ be used by anyone.

Example
------

```http
HTTP/1.1 306 Switch Proxy
Set-Proxy: SET; proxyURI="https://proxy.example.org:8080/" scope="http://", seconds=100
```
The preceding response would tell a client to use `proxy.example.org` for all
`http://` requests for the next 100 seconds.

The scope could also be limited to specific domains, specific paths or
everything using `*`.
