[`410 Gone`][1] is a status code that can be used in cases where a resource
is gone and never coming back. It's a more specific version of
[`404 Not Found`][2].

A good example for using `410` instead of `404` is when a resource was
intentionally removed.

Using `410` can be helpful, because it signals to other people linking to
you that the link is dead and should be removed. A `404` is the default for
missing resources, and it can just mean that the owner of the site has moved
the content and didn't put the right redirects in place.

So to sum it up: `410` implies intent. 


Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 410 Gone
Content-Type: text/plain
Server: curveball/0.6.0

I deleted it and it's never coming back!
```
