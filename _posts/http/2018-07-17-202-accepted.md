[`202 Accepted`][1], means that the server accepted the request, but it's not
sure yet if the request will be completed successfully.

The specification calls it 'intentionally non-committal'. You might see APIs
using this response for for example asynchronous batch processing. HTTP
doesn't have a standard way to communicate after a request if a request 
eventually succeeded. An API using this might use some other facility to
later to do this.

For example, it might send an email to a user telling them that the batch
process worked, or it might expose another endpoint in the API that can
indicates the current status of a long-running process.

Example
-------


```http
POST /my-batch-process HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

...
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Link: </batch-status/5545> rel="http://example.org/batch-status"
Content-Length: 0
```
