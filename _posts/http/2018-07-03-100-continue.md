[100 Continue][1] is a status-code you might not deal with very often.
Generally, as a web developer, the `100 Continue` status is sent under
the hood by your webserver.


So what's it for? The best example comes from [RFC 7231][2]. Say, you're
sending a large object to the server using a `PUT` request, you may
include a `Expect` header like this:

```http
PUT /media/file.mp4  HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Length: 1073741824
Expect: 100-continue
```

This tells the server that it should respond with a `100 Continue` status code
if the server accepts the request:

```http
HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
```

When the client receives this, it tells the client the server will accept the
request, and it may start sending the request body.

The big benefit here is that if there's a problem with the request, a server
can immediately respond with an error before the client starts sending the
request body.

Themost common use-case is that a server might first require authentication
using `401 Unauthorized`.

Unfortunately, it's not always possible to hook into this functionality. With
PHP for example the average PHP script only starts running after the entire
request body has already arrived. This means we can't tell clients early
that it's not worth sending the entire request over.
