[`201 Created`][1], just like [`200 OK`][2], means that the request was
successful, but it also resulted in a new resource being created.

In the case of a `PUT` request, it means that a new resource was created on
the actual url that was specified in the request.

Example
-------

```http
PUT /new-resource HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/html
Host: example.org

...
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: "foo-bar"
```

POST requests
-------------

If you got a `201` in response to a `POST` request, it means that a new
resource was created at a different endpoint. For those cases, a `Location`
header must be included to indicate where the new resource lives.

In the following example, we're creating a new resource via `POST`, and the
server responds with the new location and the `ETag` of the new resource.

```http
POST /collection/add-member HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: example.org

{ "foo": "bar" }
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: "gir-zim"
Location: /collection/546
```

It's common misconception that `POST` is generally for creating new resources,
and `PUT` is strictly for updating them. However, the real difference is that
`PUT` should be the preferred method if the client can determine the url of
the resource it wants to create.

In practice most servers do want control over the url, perhaps because it's
tied to an auto-incrementing database id.
