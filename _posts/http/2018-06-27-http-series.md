Because I have a lot more time on my hands, and want to get into the habit of
blogging more often again, I thought it would be a fun idea to write a series
of articles on one of my favourite topics: HTTP and Webservices.

To start, I'm going to write an article on every HTTP status code. According
to the [IANA][1] page, there are at least 68 official ones, so if I write one
once per week, that's over a year worth of posts.

My goal is to try and do a good job giving my interpretation of the status
codes in a way that's easier to grasp than the official standards.

I'm probably not going to be correct all the time, so corrections are welcome
and I intend to apply changes when I receive criticisms, making them a sort
of living document.

I'm going to release the first few this week, and then switch to a weekly
schedule. Hopefully I can keep this going for a year!

Today I'm releasing the first one about [100 Continue][2].
