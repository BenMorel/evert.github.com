I just found the solution for my problem that some of the scripts in
`/etc/cron.daily` would never run, and I thought i'd share it.

This might be really obvious for some of you, but I thought if I blog this with
a clear title it might be of help for some other people as well. I had problems
googling this myself, so here is my solution:

Apparently those scripts are not allowed to have extensions such as `.sh` or
`.php`. when this is the case the scripts will simply be ignored.
