IE7 RC1 has gone [public][1]. And according to the [IE Blog][2], there were
[quite a few bugfixes][3]. Kudos for that! It will take a while before we can
actually drop support for IE 6, and I think this applies to the most of us,
since some even still support IE5 for mac..

So I decided to give it a try.. Installation was a bit tricky, because it
didnt complete the first time I tried it and the second time it took around 20
minutes to complete.. After the reboot it would hang when i tried starting it,
but when I started it 'without add-ons' it worked. Sadly I won't be able to
use it because the 'manage add-ons' is grayed out so I can't disable the
troubling add-ons.. And no add-ons, means no flash..

I wanted to run IE 7 through the [acid2 test][4] and see if it would be any
better than the last versions.. Here's the result (click to enlarge):

As you can see, although the Internet Explorer team fixed a lot of bugs, it's
not quite yet near to standards... although it is a lot closer than the
previous version.

Firefox still has some bugs too, right now the only browsers that are fully
acid2-compliant are [Opera 9][5] and [KHTML][6]-based browsers such as
[Safari][7] and [Konqueror][8].
