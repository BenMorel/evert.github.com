I just published a new version of SabreAMF, and it includes support for the
flex2 messaging system. This means you can now use flex2 remoting with great
ease.

It also includes a callback server class, which is now recommended for use
with flex2. This class handles the standard AMF3 stuff like CommandMessages
and translates Exceptions into ErrorMessages.

You can download it <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?p=SabreAMF&amp;a=d" class="dead-link">here</a>.
You can find an example on how to use the CallbackServer class
<a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?p=SabreAMF&amp;a=s&amp;file=/examples/callbackserver.php" class="dead-link">here</a>.
An article on how to use this will follow shortly.
