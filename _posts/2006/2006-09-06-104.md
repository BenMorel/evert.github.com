Renaun Erickson recently wrote [an article][1] on how to use SabreAMF with Flex
2's `services.xml` configuration file..

He had some positive critique and also made me realize I made a mistake in
confusing the 'source' and 'destination' properties in Flex' RemoteObject. I
updated the CallBackServer as soon as I could to fix that.. Be sure to download
[the updated version][2].

Also, take a look at the article, as its quite complete in explaining how to
setup Flex/FDS to communicate with SabreAMF.

The extended version
--------------------

Renaun modified the CallBackServer a bit to work more like [AMFPHP][3]. I
understand the need for this and I might add in an extra class to support this
behaviour.. It would definitely an optional one.

The most important change was that his CallBackServer now constructs classes
based on the destination and automatically invokes methods. He also added in
support for AMFPHP's `_explicitType` attribute to automatically convert arrays
and objects to a Flash/Flex class.

First thing I should note is that his implementation only works for the AMF3
part.. the AMF0 part does not have his extended behaviour. If he would have
created a new class which constructed a CallBackServer instead, and listened
to the onInvokeService this would work for both AMF0 and AMF3. I listed below
how I could recommend extending the system. Most of the code is copy-pasted
from Renauns version, except that I moved it into a separate class.

```php
<?php

// Warning, untested

require_once 'SabreAMF/CallbackServer.php';

class ServiceMapper {

   private $server;
   private $baseClassPath;

   function __construct() {

      //Construct the server
      $this->server = new SabreAMF_CallbackServer();
      // Listen to the event
      $this->server->onInvokeService = array($this,'invokeService');

   }

   function invokeService($service,$method,$arguments) {

     $dirname = realpath("./" . $this->baseClassPath);

     //Does the classpath exist    

     if (is_dir($dirname)) {
        chdir($dirname);
     } else {
       throw new Exception('Could not locate base class path: ' . $this->baseClassPath);
     }

     $classpath = $dirname . str_replace('.','/',$service) . '.php';

     //Can we actually open the file?

     if (!is_readable($classpath)) {
       throw new Exception('Could not open file: ' . $classpath);
     }

     require_once $classpath;

     $classname = str_replace('.','_',$source);

     if (!class_exists($classname)) {
        throw new Exception('Class not found: ' . $classname);
     }

     $serviceInstance = new $class;

     // Invoking the method

     return call_user_func_array(array($serviceInstance,$method),$arguments);


   }

   function setBaseClassPath($classPath = 'services/') {
      $this->baseClassPath = $classPath;
   }

   function exec() {

      return $this->server->exec();

   }

}

$server = new ServiceMapper();

$server->setBaseClassPath('services/');

$server->exec();

?>
```

I will probably add this class to the source (under a different name) when this
is well tested.

Second thing is the `_explicitType` part. While this works easily if you have
an AMFPHP background, SabreAMF has a more OOP equivalent for this. There are 3
different ways to map classes (force types).

```php
<?php

$data = array(
   'prop1' => 'val1',
   'prop2' => 'val2',
);

// If want to force a flash class in AMFPHP you would add in:

$data['_explicitType'] = 'FlashClass';

// The SabreAMF equivalent:

// Be sure this class is included in your application
require_once 'SabreAMF/TypedObject.php';

$data = new SabreAMF_TypedObject('FlashClass',$data);

?>
```

If you are making classes on the PHP backend which are replicas of Flash/Flex
classes there is an even easier way to do it, using the classmapper.

```php
<?php

//This is done on the beginning of the application, as this is usually a global thing and only has to be done at 1 point

require_once 'SabreAMF/ClassMapper.php';

SabreAMF_ClassMapper::registerClass('FlexClassName','PHPClassName');

?>
```

This will work in both directions, so if you make a request with a certain
flex class, it will also be translated to the PHP class.

There is a third way to map classes, this is mostly useful if you already have
a set of classes in your framework and you want to do extra modifications to
the data before it gets sent back to the flashplayer. This is done through the
`ITypedObject` interface..

```php
<?php
  
require_once 'SabreAMF/ITypedObject.php';

class MyClass implements SabreAMF_ITypedObject {

  public $property1;
  public $property2;
  public $secretProperty;

  function getAMFClassName() {

     return 'org.rooftop.MyFlexClass';

  }

  function getAMFData() {

     return array(
        'property1' => $this->property1;
        'property2' => $this->property2;
     );

  }

}

?>
```
