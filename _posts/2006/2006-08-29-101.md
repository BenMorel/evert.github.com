It took us a week or two, but the, new design is ready..

It is designed by Sibrand Hoekstra in his free time, and I'm quite happy with it!.

Thanks very much! I hope the new design improves funk-, and legibility.

If you want contact siep, be sure to [drop me a line][1], so i can forward it
to him. Sadly he doesn't have his portfolio finished (ever), but when he does
I will link to it.
