<p>The official debian packages for Subversion are kind of old; the latest version is 1.1. There is a more recent package available in the 'unstable' package source, but I'd rather just stay with the stable packages, because switching to unstable requires me to update a few hundred packes; and I'd just rather not..</p>

<p>To install on debian, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the subversion packages from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">the subversion site</a>.</li>
  <li>Run (as root):<br />
```
apt-get build-dep subversion libsvn0 libapache2-svn

```
This will install all the libraries you need to build subversion (among a few other packages to make a debian package out of it).</li>
  <li>Next, unpack the subversion files with:
```
tar xfvz subversion-???

```</li>
<li>Next <b>cd</b> into the directory where the files were unpacked</li>
<li>Run the regular:
```
./configure
make
make install

```
<li>You are done!</li>
</ol>
