Many people are registered for many services with different usernames,
passwords etc.. There have been a few attempts to make a central id system,
the one that is probably the most famous is Microsofts Passport service (which
then changed names to .NET accounts, which changed names to Live account). The
Passport service had a lot of trouble taking off and failed miserably in its
goals.

Recently there have been attempts to create an open decentralized identity
system. The most well-known one is [OpenID][1]. With OpenID you identify
yourself with an URL you own. The webapplication then fetches information to
identify you and sends you to a page where you can login and allow the
webapplication to log you in. This means as long as the application supports
OpenID, you only need to use 1 identification for those applications. 1
centralized place to change your password and 1 ID provider you have to trust.

The biggest player currently using this is [LiveJournal][2]. They also
developed the initial spec of openid. [Verisign][3]{:.dead-link} also recently
jumped on the bandwagon..

In this article I will show how to create an OpenId client. Before you start
its recommended to create an account somewhere that supports OpenID.. else
you will have nothing to test with. You can do this at for example
[LiveJournal.com][2] or [claimid.com][4]

After you did that, you might also want to try logging in
[somewhere](http://openid.net/wiki/index.php?title=Special:OpenIDLogin&returnto=Main_Page),
just so you know how the procedure works from a client perspective.

The basics
----------

Three parties are involved in OpenID; the client (user or browser), the
consumer site  (the place where a user wants to log in), and the identity
provider (the server thats hosts your identity).

These are the steps for the logging in process.

1. User fills in his identity url
2. Consumer site fetches the url and tries to find the identity provider
   address.
3. Consumer site associates itself with the identity provider and retrieves a
   key.
4. Consumer site (http-)redirects the user to the identity provider.
5. If the user is not logged into the identity provider, it will do this now.
6. User allows (or disallows) the consumer site to have access to the identity.
7. Identity provider redirects the user back to the consumer site.
8. Consumer site matches the key in the url with the key he received from the
   identity provider and logs in the user.

The html
--------

I will just go through the process step by step, and the first thing is the
login box.

The box only has one field, which is the (url) identifier. There are 2 things
you have to consider. First, there's a small logo in the input field, which
allows people to reconize this loginbox as an openid one, and a naming
convention for the name="" attribute, which should be: "openid_url". This
allows browsers to autocomplete the id url (as long as people stick to the
convention).

Here's an example of how it should look like:

<input type="text" name="openid_url" style="padding-left: 18px; background-image: url('http://openid.net/login-bg.gif'); background-repeat: no-repeat" />
<input type="submit" value="login" />


And the code:

```html
<form action="/openidlogin1.php" method="post">
  <input type="text" class="openid_url" name="openid_url" />
  <input type="submit" value="login" />
</form>
```

The css:

```css
.openid_url {
    padding-left: 18px;
    background-image: url('http://openid.net/login-bg.gif');
    background-repeat: no-repeat
}
```

Finding the provider url
------------------------

Once the user has entered their id, and pressed 'login' we enter the PHP
realm, and there's a bunch of things we need to detect at this point.

First, we fetch the html page, then we check out the `<head>` section and
look for `<link>` tags, which, in the case of livejournal, could look like
this:

```html
<link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml">
<link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://exampleuser.livejournal.com/">
```

`openid.server` tells us the url where we should submit our API calls to. If
`opeid.delegate` is in this page, the authentication is delegated to a different
identity and we should fetch that page instead. You could see 'delegate' as an
alias for your account.

I am not going to show you how you can exactly find and parse html elements,
instead we are going to use the [MetaDetector](http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?a=d&p=MetaDetector){:.dead-link}
library. This is a lightweight library to find this kind of meta data from
pages. If you want an example of how this library works, check out
[/blogdetect](/code){:.dead-link} and fill in your openid identity.

After you downloaded and unpacked the MetaDetector library, place the 'Sabre'
directory in the same directory as your script, or some directory on the server
that is included by the PHP.INI setting `include_path`.

First, a code snippet that will show how to find the openid meta data in the
identity url.

    <?php

    // We need the metaparser
    require_once 'Sabre/Web/MetaParser.php';

    // The url from the form
    $url = $_REQUEST['openid_url'];

    // We create a metaparser
    $mp = new Sabre_Web_MetaParser($url);

    // And execute
    $metaData = $mp->exec();

    ?>

We now have the information we need in the $metaData variable. But, in some
cases we will find openid.delegate information, and we have to accommodate for
that. *This code replaces the first code snippet*.

    <?php

    // We need the metaparser
    require_once 'Sabre/Web/MetaParser.php';

    // The identity
    $idUrl = $_REQUEST['openid_url'];

    // The url we're gonna authenticate with
    // (if there was delegation this url will be different)
    $authUrl = $url;

    // We need to add a slash after the url where there is just a domain..
    // This is not in the spec, but without it, some identity providers seem to require it (livejournal for example).
    $url = parse_url($authUrl);
    $authUrl = $url['scheme'] . '://' . $url['host'];
    if (isset($url['port'])) $authUrl.=':' . $url['port'];
    if (isset($url['path'])) $authUrl.=$path; else $id.='/';
    if (isset($url['query'])) $authUrl.='?' . $url['query'];

    function findProviderURL(&$id_url) {

      // Create the metaparser
      $mp = new Sabre_Web_MetaParser($id_url);

      // Execute
      $metaData = $mp->exec();

      // Do we have a delegation?
      if (isset($metaData['openid.delegate'])) {

        $id_url = $metaData['openid.delegate'];
        return findProviderURL($metaData['openid.delegate']);

      }

      if (!isset($metaData['openid.server'])) {

         // Error handling here, we didnt find openid information

      } else return $metaData['openid.server'];

    }

    // Find the provider url
    $providerURL = findProviderURL($authUrl);
    ?>

Getting the provider secret
---------------------------

Now we need to find the provider secret by doing a post request to the server.
Along with the MetaDetector library there was also a small class to do http
requests, so we're gonna use that. (append this to the previous code snippet)

    <?php

    function doPostRequest($vars) {

        $r = new Sabre_HTTP_Request($this->serverUrl);
        $r->setRequestType('POST');
        $r->setRequestContentType('application/x-www-form-urlencoded');

        $vars2 = array();
        foreach($vars as $k=>$v) $vars2[] = $k.'=' . urlencode($v);

        $r->setRequestData(implode('&',$vars2));
        $data = $r->exec();
        $data = explode("\n",$data);
        $rvars = array();
        foreach($data as $l) {

            if (!$l) break;
            $yo = explode(':',$l,2);
            $rvars[$yo[0]] = $yo[1];

        }

        return $rvars;

    }

    function getProviderData() {

        // This sends an associate requests, which should return the provider secret
        return doPostRequest(array(
            'openid.mode' => 'associate'
        ));

    }

    $providerData = getProviderData();

    ?>

The next thing we need to do, is send off the user to the provider url, and
there are a few things we have to pass along.

<table>
  <tr><td>openid.mode</td><td>This has to be 'checkid_setup'.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>openid.identity</td><td>This is the identification url we want to authenticate.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>openid.return_to</td><td>This is the url we want the user to return to after authentication</td></tr>
  <tr><td>openid.trust_root</td><td>This is our domain, it means we will authenticate the user for this domain and keep it valid for the entire domain.</td></tr>
</table>

To redirect our user here, we need the following code-snippet. **Append this to the previous code snippet**.

    <?php

      // Append this to the end of the previous script
      // The domain we want to authenticate (change this)
      $domain = 'http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl';

      // Where the user should land after authentication
      //(should be in the same domain as $domain)

      $returnto = $domain . '/openidlogin2.php';
      /* We want to make sure the user that tried to
         login is the same as the user that will go to the landing page.
         This is why we save some of the information in session variables
         to check later on.

         You are required to check yourself if cookies are supported on the client!
      */

      $_SESSION['openid.authUrl']  = $authUrl;
      $_SESSION['openid.idUrl'] = $idUrl;
      $_SESSION['openid.confirmed'] = false;

      $location = $providerURL . '?openid.mode=checkid_setup';
      $location .= '&openid.identity=' . urlencode($authUrl);
      $location .= '&openid.return_to=' . urlencode($returnto);
      $location .= '&openid.trust_root=' . urlencode($domain);

      header('Location: ' . $location);

    ?>

When a user authenticated itself (or not) it will be redirected to
openidlogin2.php, with a bunch of `_GET` variables. We now need to check those
variables to see if things worked out or not.
