I killed the sshd daemon from one of our servers by accident today. I wanted
to avoid going to the data center, so I was able to upload and run a PHP
script to give me a shell.

Problem was, that it would run under the www-data user and trying to su to
root gave me the following message:

```
su : must be run from a terminal
```

After some googling, I found the solution from
<a href="http://tero.marttila.de/" class="dead-link">Tero's glob</a>. If you
have python installed, just run the following from your shell:

```sh
echo "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/asdf.py
python /tmp/asdf.py
```

You now have a proper terminal, and things like 'su' will work as usual.
