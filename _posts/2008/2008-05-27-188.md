<p>I just put a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/downloads/list">new release</a> for SabreDAV up.</p>

<p>The most significant change is that it now has a filter which intercepts common files generated by clients and other application, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>OS/X resource forks (._ files)</li>
  <li>OS/X .DS_Store file</li>
  <li>Windows' desktop.ini</li>
  <li>Windows' Thumbs.db</li>
  <li>ViM-style temporary files.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is crucial if you want to connect a WebDAV folder to for example a database-table. This makes sure that you don't end up with for example blog posts named .DS_Store ;). Although not completely sure, I believe SabreDAV is unique in that sense. If there are suggestions for more common 'temporary files', please let me know.</p>

<p>Full list of changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/w/list">Documentation</a></li>
  <li>Support for Windows XP / Vista clients</li>
  <li>Quota support (by implementing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/source/browse/trunk/Sabre/DAV/IQuota.php">Sabre_DAV_IQuota</a>).</li>
  <li>A standard <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/source/browse/trunk/Sabre/DAV/FilterTree.php">FilterTree</a>, which can be used to intercept or change requests to the File-tree</li>
  <li>Better implementation for PropPatch.</li>
  <li>Support for lock-null requests.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/source/browse/trunk/Sabre/DAV/TemporaryFileFilter.php">TemporaryFileFilter</a> class, which can be used to intercept the temporary files mentioned earlier. Just pass it a regular Sabre_DAV_ObjectTree and it will do its thing.</li>
</ul>
