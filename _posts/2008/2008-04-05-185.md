<p>I finished a first alpha release for SabreDAV. I'm quite excited, I might add..</p>

<p>Currently it has all the basic tools to create a WebDAV share using PHP, based on either an existing directory structure on the filesystem, your own custom virtual folder or a combination of both.</p>

<p>It has been tested using DavFS and the OS/X finder. And it supports all of the locking features these clients use, making it a fully read-write DAV server.</p>

<p>Some links:</p>

<p>If you like the idea, please support it by adding it to your <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/sabredav">ohloh stack</a>.</p>
